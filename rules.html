					Online) rules. Failure to follow said rules will result in mod (moderator/administration member)
					intervention, a warning, a kick, or in more severe cases, a ban. <br> <b
						style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b> is the administration team role on KFO's
					Discord. <br>[M] prefix in OOC names ([M] CW) is the administration team member in-client.
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 0: All of the Discord Community Guidelines apply and
						will be enforced for Killing Fever Online, affiliated servers and the Game Server. </button>
					<div class="content"> Killing Fever Online is a <a
							href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312" target="_blank">Public
							Discord Community Server</a> and has a responsibility to uphold the <a
							href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Discord Community Guidelines</a>.
						These same guidelines apply and will be enforced for the game server and affiliated servers (RP
						Discords etc.) where applicable.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 1: This is an English-speaking server.</button>
					<div class="content"> Please use the English language during full conversation in Discord and
						Out-Of-Character (OOC) chat. You are permitted to use a different language during a role-play so
						long as the role-play hosts have allowed it. Affiliated servers (RP Discords etc.) are allowed
						to speak different language(s) as long as it is clear in the rules of that server.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 2: Constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged
						on this server.</button>
					<div class="content"> By Constructive Criticism we mean criticizing characters, role-plays, game
						modes, role-play hosts, games, etc. without making it personal - "Oh, this character was
						garbage. They didn't even act like a human being." is fine, as it does not imply the player
						behind that character is unable to act like a human being. You are also allowed to criticize
						past actions and behaviors of members of the community on the server and it will not be
						considered under the "personal details" rule. </div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 3: Insulting is forbidden if consent is explicitly
						retracted by the person who is insulted. </button>
					<div class="content"> "Explicitly retracted" means that consent is assumed unless specified
						otherwise, which can be done either publicly towards the person insulting or brought to the
						moderators so they can retract consent on their behalf. Banter, which is insulting someone with
						their consent, is allowed. </div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 4: Do not mention personal details if consent is
						explicitly retracted</button>
					<div class="content">Consent is NOT assumed unless specified otherwise. While a person's personal
						life should generally be left off limits, you are allowed to mention aspects of someone's life
						as long as it's with their consent. Should a person find their likeness used in a discussion
						uncomfortable or unacceptable, they have the right to ask for the conversation to exclude them.
						<br> Insulting or criticizing anyone personally, including but not limited to their race,
						ethnicity, caste, national origin, sex, gender identity, gender presentation, sexual
						orientation, religious affiliation, age, serious illness, disabilities, or other protected
						classifications and anything prejudiced is strictly forbidden. <br> <b>EXCEPTION</b>: Affiliated
						servers (RP Discords etc.) are allowed to have insults or criticisms to anyone personally but
						only with consent. If such jokes are being made when consent is broken, the rule is considered
						to be broken and administrative action will be taken against offending parties. </div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 5: No slurs, hate speech, derogatory terms and
						insults aimed at entire demographics on any basis even with consent.</button>
					<div class="content"> You may not employ slurs, hate speech, derogatory terms and insults aimed at
						entire demographics, groups or minorities on any basis even with consent, such speech included
						but not limited to: <br> n*gger, f*ggot, r*tard, sp*stic, m*ngoloid, ch*nk, tr*nny, etc. </div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 6: You are not allowed to instigate drama or raiding
						between groups.</button>
					<div class="content"> You may not insult or criticize every member of a group as a whole, be it a
						different Attorney Online server, role-playing group, a fanbase, etc. <br> You are not allowed
						to raid and harass those groups while differentiating yourself as a KFO user. The same is
						expected from those groups in regards to KFO! Harassment of a group or members of a group is in
						breach of <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Discord Community
							Guidelines</a> and will be enforced accordingly. <br> You are allowed to discuss your
						personal experience with a particular group as long as it is made clear you are not referring to
						everyone who is part of that group. For example, saying "Undertale fans are shitlords" is not
						allowed because anyone who identifies themselves as "a fan of Undertale" is criticized and
						insulted regardless if it's fair. However, saying "Certain Undertale fans are shitlords" is
						allowed as you're not insulting everyone who's part of that group as "shitlords", just certain
						people you personally take issue with, and you do not have to name them. <br> Serious unproven
						allegations against groups or their individuals such as activities in breach of <a
							href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Discord Community Guidelines</a> or
						the law (sexualization of minors, illegal activities etc.) must be taken to the administration
						staff for a full investigation and/or reported to Discord. It is not allowed to make such
						allegations in public. </div>

				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 7: No NSFW (Not Safe For Work) media and no ERP
						(Erotic Role-Play). </button>
					<div class="content"> Going into explicit detail of sexual acts is forbidden. Implication of sexual
						acts or a non-explicit statement of the act is allowed as long as it isn't detailed and follows
						the Disclaimer rule (Rule 8).<br> Any media posted must contain room for doubt of its explicit
						nature. Censoring, cropping, etc. must alter the underlying context of the media enough to
						create room for doubt. <br> Excessively graphic artistic depictions of violence including
						mangled or dismembered bodies or body parts must follow the disclaimer rule and must always be
						spoiler tagged. <br> In-Character rape is forbidden under any circumstances even if the
						role-play has a disclaimer. Rape can be part of somebody's backstory or discussed In-Character
						only with a disclaimer (Rule 8). <br> Sexualizing minors or characters that obviously look like
						minors is forbidden under any circumstances, even with disclaimers. If there's doubt over
						whether something counts as sexualizing minors, consider asking a mod.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 8: Use disclaimers for sensitive topics.</button>
					<div class="content">
						<b>Any depiction or discussion of serious abuse, intense violence or sexual acts</b> without

						Out-Of-Character manner on the game server or affiliated servers (RP Discords etc.) must only
						occur with mutual consent from anyone with access to that space. <b>Role-plays</b> diving into
						<b>risky or provocative topics</b> that would be <b>relevant to this rule</b> or <b>feature
							derogatory terms</b> terms that would be otherwise unacceptable must also contain a
						disclaimer/content warning on the main doc and the sign-up announcement that is clearly
						communicated to anyone who wishes to know about the role-play. <br>
						<b>DISCLAIMER</b>: The administration team reserves the right to forbid a role-play from using
						derogatory terms, serious abuse, intense violence or sexual acts and discussion of such topics
						if by the administration team's sole discretion they determine such depictions/discussions to be
						excessive or offensive.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 9: Affiliated servers are subject to these
						rules.</button>
					<div class="content"> A server may be a discord server, a game server, teamspeak, etc. <br> A server
						is considered affiliated if the link to join that server is publicly accessible from the Killing
						Fever Online Discord, such as linking a roleplay discord in the <b
							class="channel">#rp-announcements</b> channel, in the main doc of the roleplay, having it in
						the sign-up form, etc. <br> A server is considered affiliated if the owner of that server claims
						affiliation and the Killing Fever Online administration confirms that claim. <br> A server is
						considered no longer affiliated two weeks after any of the above conditions are no longer true -
						for example, if a roleplay hosted on KFO ends, the invite link is no longer available and the
						owner of that server retracts affiliation from Killing Fever Online. The rules still have to be
						enforced within that two week period, and all rule breaks occurring at the time of affiliation
						can still be acted on.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 10: A KFO member can be reported for rulebreaks
						occurring in private, such as DM's or group chats.</button>

						of the incident, such as screenshots of DM's etc. </div>

						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 12: No spamming.</button>
					<div class="content"> Exceptions are the laboratory on the server, which should be reserved for
						testing custom content, and the channel marked with poo emoji <b>💩</b> in the discord.<br>On
						Discord, using bot commands outside of <b class="channel">#bots</b> should be kept as limited as
						possible. Spamming is allowed within reason on the server only in in-character chat during the
						looking-for-players/recess status of the role-play. If you are a host of the role-play and want
						it to stop, however, use <b>/area_mute</b> to prevent anyone but the administration
						team/role-play hosts from speaking in it (<b>/area_unmute</b> to revert this, <b>/invite</b> and
						<b>/uninvite</b> to only allow specific people to speak.). Spamming User pings, Role pings,

						spoiler discussions and untagged spoilers outside of <b class="channel">#spoilers</b> will be
						deleted. Fake spoilers count as well, though this will be judged on a case by case basis (e.g.
						dora the explorer dies in infinity war is an obvious joke when a simple "dora dies" can be taken
						as a spoiler). However, be wary that the main server content may contain spoilers. Full list of

					<div class="content"> You may leave mid-session or even before the role-play starts. If you have to
						be busy, are pulled off by your parents, your power went out, your schedule changed or you're
						simply not enjoying the role-play, the administration team may not get involved and you will not
						be punished - please be honest with your role-play hosts and explain your circumstance if

				<div class="container rule">
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 17: To host RPs on KFO, please follow this
						rule.</button>
					<div class="content"> There is a distinction between role-play hosts:<br> A <b>Game Master</b> (GM),
						who made the first role-play announcement, hosts the majority of the sessions and must own the
						role-play discord if there is one, and<br>
						<b>Co-Game Master</b> (Co-GM), who is assisting the GM with hosting sessions, making subsequent
						announcements and/or assisting with the scheduling.<br> In-client, a <b>Case Manager</b> (CM) is
						the person who has full control of only an individual area, as opposed to the Hub. This is
						mostly relevant for Hub 0 single-area role-plays. They will be treated as a GM or Co-GM as far
						as the rules are concerned. <br><br>If you wish to host an RP on KFO, here is a step-by-step
						process: <ol type="1">
							<li> Grab the <b style="color: rgb(241, 221, 37);">@Game Masters</b> role by going to the <b
									class="channel">#bots</b> channel and using <b>.role Game Masters</b>. This will
								grant you access to the #rp-planning channel. </li>
							<li> For any RP that lasts beyond a single session (<b>Longform/Chrono/Weekly</b>), using a
								<b style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b> tag in the <b
									class="channel">#rp-planning</b> to get permission is <b>required</b>. You must also
								use this tag <b>every time your scheduled Main Day must change.</b>
								<br> You do not need permission for a single-session RP (<b>One-off</b>). If your
								single-session RP transforms into a multiple-session RP, please inform the <b
									style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b> in the<b
									class="channel">#rp-planning</b> and ask for permission. <ol type="a">
									<li> If your RP does not have open sign-ups (private RP or one carrying over from
										another server) <b>you must still follow this rule.</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Multiple RPs may occupy the same time slot as long as there are enough server
											resources</b> (Hubs, Rooms) to accommodate them. If there aren't enough
										server resources, the server will be updated to accommodate these RPs as soon as
										possible!
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>A GM must declare the "main day" for the role-play</b> (the day they input in the KFO
								scheduler). After that, a GM reserves the right to run <b>as many times as they want</b>
								during the week, but <b>hub priority is given to role-plays that run on any said day as
									their main day.</b>
								<ol type="a">
									<li> In the event of scheduling conflicts, <b>the RP that was scheduled earlier will
											take priority.</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> If the administration team deems your RP's runtime excessive
										they reserve the right to reduce the amount of times your RP is being hosted as
										long as there is reasoning behind this decision.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Schedule your RP.</b> The Scheduler link is accessible in the <b
									class="channel">#rp-planning</b> channel description or <a
									href="https://teamup.com/kspnshfecf7wczrug1" target="_blank">here</a>. If the RP is
								scheduled more than a day in advance, you must make an entry for your RP with an
								approximate (preferably exact) start time.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Discuss the schedule with other</b> <b style="color: rgb(241, 221, 37);">@Game
									Masters</b> to avoid possible conflicts. Make sure to select a Hub or Room to use
								that isn't already occupied.
							</li>
							<li> Use the <b class="channel">#rp-announcements</b> channel to announce your RP opening
								sign-ups or information pertaining to the RP. If you're in doubt your information is
								relevant to the channel, feel free to ask the <b
									style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b>. </li>
							<li> You may also request the administration team to <b>pin your sign-up announcement</b> to
								indicate that you are still looking for players! Make sure to have the announcement
								unpinned when you are closing sign-ups. </li>
