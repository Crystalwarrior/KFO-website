				In this document, you will be able to read the KFO (Killing Fever Online) rules.
				Failure to follow said rules will result in mod (moderator/administration member)
				intervention, a warning, a kick, or in more severe cases, a ban.
				<br> <b style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b> is the administration team role on KFO's
				Discord.
				<br>[M] prefix in OOC names ([M] Apollo or [M] CW) is the administration team member in-client.
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 0: This is an English-speaking server.</button>
				<div class="content">
					Please use the English language during full conversation in Discord and Out-Of-Character (OOC) chat.
					You are permitted to use a different language during a role-play so long as the role-play hosts have
					allowed it.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 1: Constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged on
					this server.</button>
				<div class="content">
					By Constructive Criticism we mean criticizing characters, role-plays, game modes, role-play
					hosts, games, etc. without making it personal - "Oh, this character was garbage. They didn't
					even act like a human being." is fine, as it does not imply the player behind that character is unable to act like a
					human being. You are also allowed to criticize past actions and behaviors of members of the community on the server.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 2: Insulting is forbidden if consent is explicitly
					retracted by the person who is insulted.
				</button>
				<div class="content">
					Friendly banter, which is insulting someone with their consent, is allowed. However,
					<b>Insulting or criticizing anyone personally, </b>including but not limited to their sexuality,
					gender identity, disabilities, ailments, race, political beliefs, personal details and anything
					prejudiced is strictly forbidden.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 3: No slurs, hate speech, derogatory terms and insults
					aimed at entire demographics on any basis even with consent.</button>
				<div class="content">
					You may not employ slurs, hate speech, derogatory terms and insults aimed at entire demographics,
					groups or minorities on any basis even with consent, such speech included but not limited to:
					<br>
					n*gger, f*ggot, r*tard, sp*stic, m*ngoloid, ch*nk, tr*nny, etc.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 4: Do not mention personal details if consent is
					explicitly retracted</button>
				<div class="content">While a person's personal life should generally be left off limits, you are allowed
					to mention aspects of someone's life as long as it's not meant to insult them. <b>Should a person
						find their likeness used in a discussion uncomfortable or unacceptable, they have the right to
						ask for the conversation to exclude them.</b>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 5: Use disclaimers for sensitive topics.</button>
				<div class="content">
					<b>Any depiction or discussion of serious abuse, intense violence or sexual acts</b> without directly
					infringing on the NSFW rule (Rule 7) must be <b
						style="background-color: rgb(70, 70, 70); color:rgb(201, 201, 201)">||spoiler-tagged||</b>
					with a content warning and/or moved to the appropriate channel such as <b
						class="channel">#serious-topics</b> on the KFO Discord.
					Discussing such topics in an Out-Of-Character manner on the game server must only occur with mutual consent from anyone with access to that area.
					<b>Role-plays</b> diving into <b>risky or provocative topics</b> that would be <b>relevant to this rule</b> or <b>feature derogatory terms</b> that would be unacceptable must also contain a disclaimer/content warning on
					the main doc and the sign-up announcement that is clearly communicated to anyone who wishes to know about the role-play. <br>
					<b>DISCLAIMER</b>: The administration team reserves the right to forbid a role-play from using derogatory
					terms, serious abuse, intense violence or sexual acts and discussion
					of such topics if by the administration team's sole discretion they determine such
					depictions/discussions to be excessive or offensive.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 6: If you intend to criticize KFO, please do so as an individual, not a representative of a group.</button>
				<div class="content">
					You are not allowed to create drama between KFO members by
					instigating factionalism. Factionalism refers to arguments or disputes between two or more small groups
					(Instigating fights between groups of members) from
					within a larger group (KFO discord/main server). Should any group maintain an insulting behavior towards
					other users or the community as a whole while differentiating
					themselves from the larger group (KFO discord/main server), the administration team reserves the right
					to judge the situation as factionalism and act accordingly.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 7: KFO users are not allowed to raid other servers with the intent of starting conflict with other groups.</button>
				<div class="content">
					Should they do so, the admins will examine those situations and
					act accordingly. KFO requests the same be done from other groups/servers and if you intend to represent
					a group/server in our territory, act respectful and follow the rules
					we have established here.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 8: No ERP (Erotic Role-Play) is permitted on this server.</button>
				<div class="content">
					Imply it all you want but role-playing or detailing the explicit sexual acts will break this rule.
					Hugging, kissing and handholding are allowed to be detailed.
					You are allowed to have sex/fondle/spank/etc. but you are not allowed to go into detail on that. Nothing
					should be typed out other than "They had sex" and that's it.
					<b>EXCEPTION:</b> In-character rape even without explicit detailing <b>will break this rule</b>, even if
					the role-play had a disclaimer, however, it can be part of somebody's
					backstory or be talked about <b>only with a disclaimer.</b>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 9: No NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content is allowed on this
					server.</button>
				<div class="content">
					Any image/video posted must contain room for doubt of its explicit nature. Censoring, cropping, etc.
					must alter the underlying context of the image/video enough to create room for doubt. This rule is also
					violated if you go into detail over sexual acts to the point where rule #6
					applies. Excessively graphic animated depictions of violence including mangled or dismembered bodies or
					body parts require mod approval, spoiler tagging and gore warning.
					Real depictions of gore are forbidden.
					Anything that violates Discord Terms of Service is strictly forbidden.
					If you feel like what you're about to post crosses some line, it's best to clarify with the
					administration team before posting it.

			</div>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 10: Members are generally discouraged from breaking any of KFO's rules in
					another member's DMs or in affiliated servers.</button>
				<div class="content">
					If a member is breaking any of said rules, you are allowed and encouraged to contact the administration team about the
					situation with proof of the incident(s). This extends to discord channels and other venues of communication made to add
					people participating in RPs hosted on the KFO server, such as longform discords etc.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 11: Do not promote joining other servers unless specifically approved
					by the administration team.</button>
				<div class="content">This includes asking people to join RP's unaffiliated with KFO. <ol>
						<li> Any Discord link you include in the <b class="channel">#rp-announcements</b> channel that belongs to
							you is considered to be affiliated unless specified otherwise by the administration team. </li>
						<li> Discord channels created for the express purpose of the RP hosted on KFO will become affiliated. </li>
					</ol>

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 12: Spamming is against the rules in all areas.</button>
				<div class="content">
					Other than the laboratory on the server, which should be reserved for testing custom content,
					and the channel marked with poo emoji <b>💩</b> in the discord.<br>On Discord, using bot commands
					outside of
					<b class="channel">#bots</b> should be kept as limited as possible. Spamming is allowed within reason on
					the server
					only in in-character chat during the looking-for-players/recess status of the role-play. If you are a
					host of the role-play and want it to stop, however, use <b>/area_mute</b>
					to prevent anyone but the administration team/role-play hosts from speaking in it (<b>/area_unmute</b>
					to revert this, <b>/invite</b> and <b>/uninvite</b> to only allow specific people to speak.).
					Spamming User pings, Role pings, unnecessary <b style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b>
					pings or mod calls in-client will also result in punishment.

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 13: No Spoilers outside of the spoilers channel on the KFO discord unless appropriately defined and tagged.</button>
				<div class="content">
					With Title spoiler: ||Spoiler||, e.g. AA1 spoiler:
					||Somebody dies||. Full spoiler discussions and untagged spoilers outside of <b
						class="channel">#spoilers</b>
					will be deleted. Fake spoilers count as well, though this will be
					judged on a case by case basis (e.g. dora the explorer dies in infinity war is an obvious joke when a
					simple "dora dies" can be taken as a spoiler).However,
					be wary that the main server content may contain spoilers. Full list of franchises can be seen <a

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 14: Anyone can leave a role-play or withdraw from the sign-ups for any reason.</button>
				<div class="content">
					You may leave mid-session or even before the role-play starts. If you have to be busy, are
					pulled off by your parents, your power went out, your schedule changed or you're simply not enjoying the
					role-play, the administration team may not get involved and
					you will not be punished - please be honest with your role-play hosts and explain your circumstance if
					possible.
					<br><b>EXCEPTION:</b> If it is determined that you leaving role-plays becomes a pattern (Ghosting) you
					may be reported by the role-play hosts/other players and the administration
					team reserves the right to <b>inform everyone in the <b class="channel">#mod-log</b> of your
						exploitative behavior.</b> No punishment will be made beyond that unless other rules have been
					broken as well.

			<div class="container rule">
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 15: The role-play hosts reserve the right to accept or deny whoever
					they wish for their role-play.</button>
				<div class="content">
					This goes both ways - you may withdraw your sign-up as a player if you think someone was denied their spot
					unfairly. The administration team may not get involved in such a decision - they would only get involved if
					other rules were broken as well.
				</div>

				<div class="content">
					You may host your role-play on any of the Room areas in /hub 0. If you only need a single location, or in any of the
					unclaimed Hubs (/hub) if your role-play needs multiple locations or functionality specific to hubs.
					<b>You are not allowed to use custom content in Hub 0 in all Areas</b> other
					than Area 11 - Custom Content Room, and Area 13 - Laboratory. Outside of <b>Hub 0</b>, you are
					<b>allowed to use custom content in role-plays with permission from the role-play hosts.</b>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rule 17: Game Masters are the main hosts of the roleplay, co-Game Masters are
					their support.</button>
				<div class="content">
					There is a distinction between role-play hosts:<br>
					A <b>Game Master</b> (GM), who made the first role-play announcement, hosts the majority of the sessions
					and must own the role-play discord if there is one, and<br>
					<b>Co-Game Master</b> (Co-GM), who is assisting the GM with hosting sessions, making subsequent
					announcements and/or assisting with the scheduling.<br>
					In-client, a <b>Case Manager</b> (CM) is the person who has full control of only an individual area, as
					opposed to the Hub. This is mostly relevant for Hub 0 single-area role-plays. They will be treated as a
					GM or Co-GM as far as the rules are concerned.
					<br><br>If you wish to host an RP on KFO, here is a step-by-step process:
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							Grab the <b style="color: rgb(241, 221, 37);">@Game Masters</b> role by going to the

							This will grant you access to the #rp-planning channel.
						</li>
						<li>
							For any RP that lasts beyond a single session (<b>Longform/Chrono/Weekly</b>), using a <b
								style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b> tag in the <b class="channel">#rp-planning</b> to get
							permission is <b>required</b>. You must
							also use this tag <b>every time your scheduled Main Day must change.</b>
							<br> You do not need permission for a single-session RP (b>One-off</b>). If your single-session RP transforms into a
							multiple-session RP, please inform the <b style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b> in the<b
								class="channel">#rp-planning</b> and ask for permission.
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									If your RP does not have open sign-ups (private RP or one carrying over from another
									server) <b>you must still follow this rule.</b>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Multiple RPs may occupy the same time slot as long as there are enough server
										resources</b> (Hubs, Rooms) to accommodate them. If there aren't enough server resources, the server will be updated to
										accommodate these RPs as soon as possible!
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>A GM must declare the "main day" for the role-play</b> (the day they input in the KFO
							scheduler). After that, a GM reserves the right to run
							<b>as many times as they want</b> during the week, but <b>hub priority is given to role-plays
								that run on any said day as their main day.</b>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									In the event of scheduling conflicts, <b>the RP that was scheduled earlier will take
										priority.</b>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> If the administration team deems your RP's runtime excessive they
									reserve the right to reduce
									the amount of times your RP is being hosted as long as there is reasoning behind this
									decision.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Schedule your RP.</b> The Scheduler link is accessible in the <b
								class="channel">#rp-planning</b>
							channel description or
							<a href="https://teamup.com/kspnshfecf7wczrug1" target="_blank">here</a>. If the RP is scheduled
							more than a day in advance,
							you must make an entry for your RP with an approximate (preferably exact) start time.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Discuss the schedule with other</b> <b style="color: rgb(241, 221, 37);">@Game Masters</b> to
							avoid possible conflicts.
							Make sure to select a Hub or Room to use that isn't already occupied.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use the <b class="channel">#rp-announcements</b> channel to announce your RP opening sign-ups or
							information pertaining to the RP.
							If you're in doubt your information is relevant to the channel, feel free to ask the <b
								style="color:rgb(196, 27, 196);">@Shadow Council</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							You may also request the administration team to <b>pin your sign-up announcement</b> to indicate

							Make sure to have the announcement unpinned when you are closing sign-ups.
